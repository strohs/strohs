- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @strohs, a software engineer based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things and I'm always eager to learn something new. My main areas of expertise are backend development with Java, Spring Framework and AWS. But I've also dabbled on the frontend with Vue.js and Node.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently becoming even more proficient with Rust, as well as Python.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, email: strohs1@gmail.com
